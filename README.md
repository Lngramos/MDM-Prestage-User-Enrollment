The MDM-Prestage-User-Enrollment workflow is designed to minimize work for JumpCloud admins. JumpCloud admins can leverage Apple Automated Enrollment, MDM and JumpCloud to assign users to systems as they power on their Apple computers for the first time.

With the aim to make work happen&copy;, the MDM-Prestage-User-Enrollment workflow eliminates user setup on systems and automates the process.

An implementation of the MDM-Prestage-User-Enrollment workflow allows JumpCloud enables to deploy company-owned, MacOS Computers to employees around the globe for Zero-Touch Enrollment.

## How does it work

[Apple Automated Deployment](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204142) (formally, and more commonly known as DEP) enables admins to build Zero-Touch workflows for their employees. A Mobile Deive Management Server [(MDM)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207516) is leveraged to pass configuration settings and an enrollment interface to Apple MacOS computer. Apple and a MDM verify that the MacOS device is under your organizations purview. JumpCloud verifies the identify of a user during enrollment and activates their account on the given MacOS computer.

During the enrollment phase on a MacOS computer, existing or pending JumpCloud users are asked to prove their identity. A user who authenticates successfully is provisioned with an account from JumpCloud. Existing users can retain their JumpCloud credentials, new users are prompted to create their password during enrollment

The MDM-Prestage-User-Enrollment workflow is designed to empower admins to automate their enrollment process.
